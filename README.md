SparkSQL was simple and easy to understand with our previous knowledge of postgressSQL.
Initally I had problems with reading in the correct path in order to start.
However it was quickly resolved and the rest of the challenge was smooth sailing.
It is interesting to see how we can optimize our code in order to make it run faster.
The effect it had in this assignment was minimal however I can only imagine how useful this will be when we face future problems with big data.
